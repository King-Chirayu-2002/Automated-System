# Debris Avoidance Game

This is a simple **Debris Avoidance Game** where you control a robot that navigates around a field filled with randomly placed debris. The objective is to avoid collisions and accumulate as high a score as possible.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Main programming language)
- **Pygame** (For game development and visualization)
- **Math & Random Modules** (For calculations and randomness)

## 🎮 Gameplay

- You control a robot in a field filled with debris.
- The robot tries to avoid debris autonomously by changing direction.
- Debris is randomly generated at the start, and you gain points by staying collision-free.
- The game is over once you quit the window.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Collision Avoidance**: The robot detects and avoids debris using an increased detection radius.
- **Random Movement**: Upon collision or boundary hit, the robot changes its direction randomly.
- **Score System**: Gain points for avoiding debris and lose points on collisions.

## 🖥️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/debris-avoidance-game.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies (make sure you have Python and Pygame installed):
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```

## 🎮 How to Play

- The robot moves automatically.
- Avoid collisions with debris to keep your score high.
- Watch out for screen boundaries — the robot will change direction if it hits one.
